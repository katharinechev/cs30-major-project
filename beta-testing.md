I absolutely love the concept of this game and thoroughly enjoyed playing it. I appreciated how everything was laid out nicely and was easy to follow. The rules at the start of the game were helpful to ensure I knew how to play. I like the concept that you can revise the rules while you’re playing the game in case you forget or need clarification. Furthermore, the serene music in the background is one of my favourite features and adds to the overall calmness achieved when playing this game. In regards to the actual game, the pictures chosen for each category were well thought out and made it easy to guess the word associated with the pictures. The only suggestion I would give is to perhaps include hints as to what the word could be. This would be helpful for someone who cannot guess the word and it wouldn’t prevent them from being unable to finish the game. While playing the game, I came across this issue and automatically looked for potential cues that could’ve aided me. Overall, the game is well constructed and I will definitely play it more in my free time!
