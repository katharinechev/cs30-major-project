# Reflection

## What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

- Probably to just start trying things and noting ideas of how to make things work right off the bat. I spent more time than I should have planning and testing small pieces before committing to the project
- Not to worry too much about trivial pieces (ie making sure things were more or less centred perfectly) and that the current look of my project was not in the same place as classmates

## Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

- Yes, I completed everything on my needs to have list


## What was the hardest part of the project?
- One of the hardest things was to work with the blanks and put the key typed in
- Another was making the background music sound image toggle and its play/pausing function
    - I stuggled to get the image to switch back and forth without leaving the previous one behind, and allow it to work on both the start and level screens
    - making the sound only play once
- Erasing things with changes in window size (ie pop up help menu)

## Were there any problems you could not solve?

- I ran into a problem with my back button (from the start screen instruction page).  
    - The button functionally works but doesn't light up (change colour) when the mouse is over it, like the other buttons of the same type would
        - I only encountered this problem with this one button
